Application Name: PokéHub
Application Type: Game / Utility 

General Description: 
A tracker utility for Pokemon Scarlet and Violet

In Pokemon, one of the main goals of the game is to catch all of the Pokemon available in that specific game. The game does not have a good way to quickly check what you have caught or need to catch in the game itself, so this app will give you a quick, easy way to keep track of everything you need to do. This app will have a screen with images of all of the catchable Pokemon in the game that you can scroll down, and you can mark the ones you caught, the ones you want to catch, and the ones that you have not caught. You will be able to filter to show all Pokemon, only caught Pokemon, uncaught Pokemon, or a certain type of Pokemon. By clicking on the Pokemon itself, you can get all the information you need about it, such as its general description, typing, stats, location on the map, etc. If you do not want to see all of that information, simply touching and holding on to the image of the Pokeon will allow the user to just see the location of the Pokemon.

Aside from just the tracker, there will be an interactive map where you can click and see what Pokemon can be found at a certain area on the map and important battles in that area as well. You will also have a menu to see all of the important battles in the game and the order you should beat them in. It will show the opponent’s Pokemon, their type, stats, highest level, etc. Once you have beaten one of the important battles, you can mark the opponent as beaten and it will move over to a different tab in the menu.

To make the game more difficult, the Pokemon community has made a gamemode called a “Nuzlocke.” In a nuzlocke, a trainer is only allowed to catch one Pokemon in each area of the game, you are forced to nickname each Pokemon you catch, and once a Pokemon faints it is considered “dead” and you can no longer use it. This app will have a tracker for your nuzlockes so you can keep track of which Pokemon you caught in a specific area, if it is alive or dead, and its nickname. There is a separate screen to see all the Pokemon you still have alive and which ones have died.

These are people who are trying to find more information on a region or pokemon. These people will be drawn to this app whether they are a casual player or a veteran player.
This app can be used for casual players who want more information about the region they are playing, and for veterans who are playing through a nuzlocke and want to keep track of their encounters and pokemon.
Anyone who owns a copy of a pokemon game via Nintendo console can use this application
Players can conveniently have all of their trackers and data in one place rather than having to google back and forth or use multiple applications to track their progress.
